# Notebar
macOS menu bar app for taking simple notes.

Opening a windowed note-taking app is slow, distracting and disruptive to my workflow, especially while using full-screen apps. Sometimes I just want to type or paste something simple down for later, and access it from anywhere, all the time, throughout the system. So I slapped a text view in a popover and called it a day.
